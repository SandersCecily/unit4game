## About the Game
This game works by using jquery to gather user input, also known as clicks on the pearls,
to add their randomly generated value to a variable and compares the two to find if the program 
should keep going, restart a new game because the player has won or restart a new gam because
the player has lost. The page is built with jquery, css, and html. Admittedly it isnt the pretties
or best formatted but, the functionality is present. The game starts on load for the player and
you're able to play as long as theres a connection to it.
